# CreditRisk-Analysis
This project uses historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The focus is on addressing the imbalanced classification problem inherent in the dataset, where healthy loans significantly outnumber risky loans.

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes to predict credit risk. This involves using logistic regression models on the original and resampled datasets and comparing their performance. The goal is to determine how well the models can predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Languages and Libraries Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
