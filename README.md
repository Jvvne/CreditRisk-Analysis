# CreditRisk-Analysis
This project uses historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The focus is on addressing the imbalanced classification problem inherent in the dataset, where healthy loans significantly outnumber risky loans.
